01-09-2024 Plan of Action

1) Software : 

various models used : 
 (1) Video processing for action recognition - MoViNet for streaming action recognition
 (2) Image processing model to recognise fights in the image 
 (3) Object detection model to determine harmful objects
 (4) Blood recognition through image

Combining these 4 models to complete the final layer of neural network and acting according to the probability of the output model.

2) Networking

If load is high using distributed computing to run the models. Find the maximum N/W speed required.

3) Hardware

Connect raspberry pi 3B+ with Rpi camera module along with buzzer and PIR sensors. Connecting an internal N/W using Iot to connect different devices and streaming video on a website.
